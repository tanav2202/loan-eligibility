## **Code of Conduct**

We want this project to be a place where everyone feels comfortable contributing, learning, and asking questions. This Code of Conduct explains the kind of environment we want to create and the behaviour we expect from anyone who takes part in this project.

Goal: be respectful, be kind, and avoid conflicts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **1. What We Care About**

We are committed to keeping this space:

-   welcoming

-   inclusive

-   supportive

-   open to all experience levels

Everyone should feel safe sharing ideas, making mistakes, asking questions, and participating in the work.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **2. How We Expect People to Behave**

-   Treat others with respect and patience.

-   Communicate clearly and politely.

-   Ask questions when unsure and help others when you can.

-   Feedback should be constructive and not criticism.

-   Give equal credit to everyone for their contribution.

-   Keep discussions focused on the project and its goals.

-   Follow project guidelines, documentation standards, and version control practices

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **3. Unacceptable Behaviour**

To keep this a safe and positive environment, the following behaviour is not acceptable:

-   Rude or dismissive comments

-   Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks

-   Making others feel unwelcome or embarrassed

-   Ignoring team agreements, responsibilities, or communication

-   Sharing private information without permission

-   Any behaviour that creates tension or discomfort for others

-   Deliberate sabotage of work

Basically: **don’t be disrespectful, don’t cause harm, and don’t make the project harder for others.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **4. If Something Goes Wrong**

If you ever feel uncomfortable or notice behaviour that doesn’t follow this Code of Conduct:

-   Reach out privately to a team member you trust/contact the course instructor/TA

-   Provide any necessary details so the issue can be handled properly

Your concerns will be taken seriously, and you won’t face any negative consequences for reporting an issue.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **5. When Behaviour Crosses the Line**

If someone behaves in a way that goes against this Code of Conduct, possible actions include:

-   A gentle reminder of expected behaviour

-   A discussion about the issue

-   Removal of inappropriate content

-   Being asked to step back from contributing

-   Informing the instructor or TA if needed

The goal is not to punish — it’s to keep the environment healthy for everyone.
