        "The loan eligibility dataset contains information on individual loan applicants and the outcomes of their applications. It includes demographic attributes such as gender, marital status, education level, and number of dependents, along with financial features including applicant income, co-applicant income, loan amount, and loan term. The dataset also records credit history and property area, both of which are key indicators of loan risk and eligibility. The target variable indicates whether each loan was approved or denied. Together, these variables provide a structured view of applicant characteristics and financial profiles, enabling analysis of loan approval patterns and the development of predictive models.\n",

Using features such as gender, education level, number of dependents, income, loan amount, credit history, and property area, the objective is to learn patterns that distinguish approved applications from rejected ones. The resulting model should accurately classify new loan applications and provide insight into the factors that most strongly influence approval decisions.\n",

The loan terms are concentrated around 3-year. The number of dependents are also mostly concentraded on $0$. In our analysis we treat the `Dependent` feature as numerical, but it can also be thought of as a categorical feature.  \n",

        "An examination of the categorical features reveals several notable differences between approved and rejected loan applications. Property area shows distinct variation across classes: applicants from “*Semiurban*” areas have a noticeably higher approval rate, while those from “*Rural*” areas are more likely to be denied. Credit history is the strongest differentiator in the dataset; applicants with a positive credit history overwhelmingly fall into the approved class, whereas those with no credit history are predominantly rejected, confirming its central role in loan eligibility decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Demographic features exhibit more modest effects. Gender shows a slight skew toward higher approval rates for male applicants, although the difference is not substantial. Married applicants tend to receive approvals more often than unmarried ones, suggesting that household structure may influence perceived creditworthiness or financial stability. Educational background also shows variation: graduates have higher approval rates than non-graduates, reflecting a possible association between education level and financial reliability. Finally, individuals who are self-employed experience a lower approval rate compared with salaried applicants, consistent with the higher income variability typically associated with self-employment.\n",

In contrast, `Loan_Term` exhibits similar quartiles across both groups, suggesting that loan duration does not meaningfully differentiate approved from rejected applications.

From this, we can see that the model is better at predicting approvals than denials.
