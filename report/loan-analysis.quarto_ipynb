It includes demographic attributes such as gender, marital status, education level, and number of dependents, along with financial features including applicant income, co-applicant income, loan amount, and loan term. The dataset also records credit history and property area, both of which are key indicators of loan risk and eligibility. The target variable indicates whether each loan was approved or denied.

The loan terms are concentrated around 3-year. The number of dependents are also mostly concentraded on $0$. In our analysis we treat the `Dependent` feature as numerical, but it can also be thought of as a categorical feature.  \n",

Property area shows distinct variation across classes: applicants from “*Semiurban*” areas have a noticeably higher approval rate, while those from “*Rural*” areas are more likely to be denied. Credit history is the strongest differentiator in the dataset; applicants with a positive credit history overwhelmingly fall into the approved class, whereas those with no credit history are predominantly rejected, confirming its central role in loan eligibility decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Demographic features exhibit more modest effects. Gender shows a slight skew toward higher approval rates for male applicants, although the difference is not substantial. Married applicants tend to receive approvals more often than unmarried ones, suggesting that household structure may influence perceived creditworthiness or financial stability. Educational background also shows variation: graduates have higher approval rates than non-graduates, reflecting a possible association between education level and financial reliability. Finally, individuals who are self-employed experience a lower approval rate compared with salaried applicants, consistent with the higher income variability typically associated with self-employment.\n",

From this, we can see that the model is better at predicting approvals than denials.
