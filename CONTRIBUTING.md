## Contribution

If you are new to the project, follow the steps below to contribute properly.

### Step 1: Get Access to the Project

- Get access to the repository.
- If you are part of the team, you will be added as a collaborator and can clone the repository directly.
- If you are an external contributor, you should fork the repository to your own account before cloning it.

### Step 2: Prepare Your Working Environment

- After obtaining access, open the repository on your computer.
- Make sure your local copy is always up to date with the latest version of the project.
- The work starts from main as the starting branch, so ensure that's where you are and your copy is current.

### Step 3: Create a New Branch for Your Work

- Every contributor should create a separate branch before starting any changes.
- This keeps the main branch clean and prevents any conflicts.
- The branch name should clearly describe the type of work being done, such as `docs/update-readme`, `feature/data-cleaning`, or `fix/validation-bug`.

### Step 4: Make Your Changes

- Complete the work you intend to contribute.
- Keep your changes focused and organized so they are easy to review.
- Write clear commit messages that explain what you changed and why.

### Step 5: Review Your Work

- Before submitting your changes, make sure everything is correct and consistent.
- Check that your writing is clear, your files are saved properly, and your edits do not break anything already in the project.
- Ensure your documentation is readable and follows the project's style.


### Step 6: Submit Your Changes for Review

- Once your work is complete, submit your branch for review through a pull request on GitHub.
- In the pull request, briefly explain what you worked on and why it improves the project.
- Reference any related issues using `#issue-number`.
- Other team members will review your contribution, ask questions if needed, and approve it once everything looks good.

### Step 7: Merge and Update

- After your contribution is approved, it will be merged into the main branch.
- Before starting any additional work, return to your local main branch and update it so you always build new changes on top of the most recent version of the project:
  ```bash
  git checkout main
  git pull origin main
  ```

### Step 8: Code of Conduct

- Please review and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to ensure a positive and respectful collaborative environment.
